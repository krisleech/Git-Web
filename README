WebGit

A simple web UI for browsing Git Repositories.

* No database required
* No authorisation / authentication
* No writes

Usage:

Edit setting.yml and add the root path to your Git Repositories.
./script/server

Dependancies:

Rails and Grit gems

TODO:

* Turn this in to an engine plugin
* Allow git commits via HTTP (would assume use of own authorisation eg. CanCan)
* Needs a nice design
